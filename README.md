# Restaurant Management - Sorting by Name and Score

## 📄 Description
A Java program that sorts a collection of restaurants by **name** and **score** in descending order. This exercise uses `TreeSet` and implements the `Comparable` interface to define custom sorting logic.

### Features
1. **Custom sorting:**
   - Implements the `compareTo` method in the `Restaurant` class.
   - Ensures restaurants are sorted:
     - **First by name** in descending order.
     - **Then by score** in descending order if names are identical.
2. **Display the collection:**
   - Iterates through the `TreeSet` to show the sorted restaurants.
